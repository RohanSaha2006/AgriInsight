# Metrics Directory

This directory contains performance metrics and evaluation results from our agricultural production models.

## Files
- **model_performance.csv**: Detailed performance metrics for our predictive models, including:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared (R²) values
  - Feature importance scores

These metrics demonstrate the significant improvement from our baseline Linear Regression model (R² = 0.16) to our advanced Random Forest model (R² = 0.85).
