# Recommendations Directory

This directory contains data-driven crop recommendations generated from our analysis.

## Files
- **crop_recommendations.csv**: Region-specific crop recommendations including:
  - Recommended crop varieties by state
  - Suitability scores for each recommendation
  - Expected yield improvements
  - Implementation guidance

Our recommendation system uses a multi-factor suitability score that considers:
- Historical yield performance (50%)
- Yield stability across seasons (30%)
- Production volume potential (20%)

These recommendations form the core output of our agricultural planning system, with the potential to increase yields by 15% when implemented.
